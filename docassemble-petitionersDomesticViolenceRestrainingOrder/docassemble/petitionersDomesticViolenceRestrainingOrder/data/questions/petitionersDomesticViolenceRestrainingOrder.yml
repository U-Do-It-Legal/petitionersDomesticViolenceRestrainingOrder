question: |
  **Introduction to TROs and DVROs**
subquestion: |
  **What is a Temporary Restraining Order?** 
  
  A temporary restraining order, or TRO, is an order for one person to temporarily stay away from another person, including their home, vehicle, work, and protected household or family members. If a TRO is granted, the court can also order the abusive person to do things like move out of a shared residence, pay utility bills or child support, not contact you, etc. 

  TROs can be valid for around three weeks (or until the scheduled court hearing) and may be made permanent after a hearing. Additionally: 
  
  - Anyone 12 and over can apply for a TRO without parental consent
  - A TRO must be filed in civil court, not criminal
  - The respondent (aka the restrained party/person abusing you) must be served with the TRO before police can enforce the order (*we will explain service at the end of this interview*)
  - A TRO is **only valid and enforceable until the date of the hearing**

  **Court Hearing**
  
  Once you submit your court forms, the court will schedule a hearing on your request. If the judge does not make the orders effective right away (i.e. grant your TRO), the judge may still make the orders after the hearing (i.e. grant your DVRO). If the judge does not make the orders effective right away, you can ask the court to cancel the hearing. 
  
  **What is a Domestic Violence Restraining Order?**
  
  Just like a TRO, a Domestic Violence Restraining Order can help protect you from an abusive partner, a family member, or someone in your household. In California, we often call this order a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (also known as a “Restraining Order After Hearing (ROAH)"). 
  
  The DVRO is a “permanent” restraining order issued by the court against the restrained party **after a hearing**. A DVRO provides the same specific restrictions of a TRO and may be ordered for up to five years. The victim may renew the order when it expires, if necessary. 
  
  **Violating the Orders** 
  
  If the abusive person does not obey a TRO or DVRO, they “violate” it. It is a crime to violate a domestic violence restraining order and the police can arrest them. 
  
  **In short:**
  
  - *If granted,* a TRO can protect you and your loved ones before and up until the date of your hearing
  - Even if a judge doesn't grant your request for a TRO, you may still be granted a DVRO at your hearing
  - *If granted,* a DVRO (aka ROAH) can protect you and your loved ones after your hearing, for up to 5 years. You may renew your DVRO before it expires, if necessary.

   **PLEASE READ:** A restraining order is only a part of your overall safety plan. We highly encourage you to speak with a domestic violence advocate for more help with safety planning.

question: |
  **Asking the court for a Domestic Violence Restraining Order:**
  Check your Elligibility
subquestion: |
  The first step in filing a Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order in California is to check whether or not you are elligible to do so. You and the restrained party must be members of the same family or household to get a Domestic Violence Restraining Order in California. You may think you are not members of the same family or household, but the law may say you are.
  
   [Family Code section 6211](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=6211.&lawCode=FAM) defines “Domestic violence,” as abuse perpetrated against any of the following persons:
   
  - A spouse or former spouse
  - A cohabitant or former cohabitant (*aka, someone you live or lived with*)
  - A person with whom the respondent is having or has had a dating or engagement relationship
  - A person with whom the respondent has had a child
  - A child of a party
  - Any other person related by consanguinity or affinity within the second degree. [Click here for a helpful graphic](https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/images/M_images/Relations/PDFS/FAMILY%20MEMBER%20CHART.pdf)

  As such, the restrained party must fall under one of the above categories in order for you to get a domestic violence restraining order against him or her. If the restrained party's relationship to you does not fall under one of the above categories, you may still be elligible to file a Civil Harassment Restraining Order.

question: |
  **Requesting Orders:** Child Custody and Visitation
subquestion: |
  Please review the information below and select 'Continue' once you are ready to proceed and request Legal Custody Orders.
under: |
  **Legal Custody:** Who makes important, long-term decisions about the child’s upbringing and welfare, such as, *Where do they go to school? What sports or activities do they do? Where do they receive healthcare and under whose insurance? What religion do they practice?*
  
  **Joint Legal Custody:** Both parents make these decisions. 
  
  **Sole Legal Custody:** One parent makes these decisions. 
   
   *Joint legal custody is most commonly awarded in cases unless the court finds one parent to be unfit or incapable of making these decisions. The court makes its determination of custody based on what is best for the child--NOT the parents.* **Please note, joint legal custody is most often unfit for cases in which domestic violence, substance abuse, or child neglect is present.** 
   
   Family Code 3044 states that a judicial finding of domestic violence (i.e. when a judicial officer grants a permanent restraining order) creates a presumption against joint custody, more specifically, that joint custody is no longer in the best interest of the child. This creates a burden of proof that a perpetrator must meet in order for a court to order joint child custody after a retraining order is issued.

  **Requesting Orders:** Child Custody and Visitation
subquestion: |
  Please review the information below and select 'Continue' once you are ready to proceed and request Physical Custody Orders.
under: |
  **Physical Custody:** Who the children live with. 
  
  **Joint Physical Custody:** The children live with both parents and alternates households based on an agreed upon visitation schedule, outlined below.
  
  **Primary Physical Custody** The children live primarily with one parent (i.e., significantly more that 50% of the custodial time).
  
  **Sole Physical Custody:** The children live in one parent’s household. 
   
   *Please note the difference between custody and vistation. Physical custody determines where the child lives, whereas visitation outlines the days/times that the child spends with each parent. For example, if you request sole physical custody of your child, this means that you're requesting that your child will live in your household--NOT that they do not get to spend time with the other parent.*

question: |
  **Requesting Orders:** Child Custody and Visitation
subquestion: |
  Please review the information below and select 'Continue' once you are ready to proceed and request Visitation Orders.
under: |
  Visitation is the schedule for how you and the other parent will share time with your children, and it is typically granted to a parent who has the children less than half of the time. There are different types of Visitation:
 
  **Visitation According to a Schedule:** This is a specific schedule, whether weekly or monthly, under which you will share time with your children with the other parent. It may be as specific or as general as you'd like and can outline a specific schedule of days, times, weekends, holidays, vacations, transportation, pick-up and drop-off, limitations on travel, and other details. A specific schedule is preferred. If you request visitation according to a schedule for ${ resp }, you may also request that it be supervised. 
  
  **Supervised Visitation:** This type of visitation plan is most often ordered when a parent is determined to present a risk to the children's safety or well-being, warranting the presence of a third party to supervise visits with the other parent. This third party can be you, another adult (*such as a friend or relative*), or a professional monitor. Supervised visitation is also used in reunification situations--where a parent and the children have not seen each other for quite some.  
  
  **No Visitation:** This option is used when visitation with the other parent, even under supervision, is not appropriate. This may be due to past emotional or physical harm that the children have suffered as a result of the other parent, or some other circumstance.

question: |
  **What to expect after filing your court forms**
subquestion: |
  When you ask the court for a domestic violence restraining order, the judge can do 3 things:

  1. Deny your request/refuse to give you a restraining order. ${ resp } will not get any notice that you asked the court for a restraining order.

  2. Make a temporary order. The judge will give you a temporary restraining order (aka a TRO) that lasts until your hearing. At the hearing, the judge can hear from both you and ${ resp } at the same time.

  3. Not make any order until they can hear from both you and ${ resp } at the same time. If the judge decides not to make an order and you decide to go to a hearing where the judge can hear from both of you, ${ resp } will find out you have asked for a restraining order.
